Welcome to PDFSimplifier!
This is a program that takes in a pdf, segments it into smaller more digestible pieces, sends them to ChatGPT to simplify the vocabulary, recompiles the bits into one big text file, and turns it into a pdf file you can read more easily!

By using this software, you agree to the license stated in 'LICENSE'.

DISCLAIMER: This program may not work on Linux/Mac!

If something goes wrong, try restarting the program and making sure all the required files and directories are present, if it still doesn't work, restart your device
If it's still not working, please contact me with the according log file (which is often the latest).
You can contact me at 'frostbyte0x0@gmail.com'.

To execute this program on your own computer, copy all the files in the 'executable' directory and paste them on your computer, then run 'PDFSimplifier.exe'.
It is suggested that you put the program in an isolated directory to avoid erasing present files.

To make an API key for OpenAPI (which is necessary for this program), follow this guide: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/openai-api-key-and-add-credits/

DISCLAIMER: Make sure the PDF file contains actual text, and not photos of text, in which case, the program will NOT work.
